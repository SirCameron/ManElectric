# ManElectric

A lot of research is going on at different points on the globe to create a robot that can walk with the same fluidity and balance as a human or animal.

I had a dreamy thought that all the developers in the world could contribute to this research by creating a virtual man/robot and getting that man to stand, walk, sit and so on.

The ideas developed and shared here could then be used to propel robotics - hopefully for the good of man and not for profit and control!

Let's start this in javascript - using HTML canvas in a 3D context.
Javascript will be a good starting point for it's rapid and interactive developmentness.


So, add yourself to the repo, and post an indication of what you'd like to contribute to the project.
We'll also need some seniour devs to manage the process here.


## Development Phases

- building the man and linking the limbs and add restraints on joints, etc.

- Making said man's limbs and body respond to foces like gravity.

- Getting that man to stand, responding to gravitational forces.

- Getting that same man to hold his balance while affected by outside forces like wind or moving floor.

- Giving that man the ability to apply internal forces to his body (muscles)

- Ensuring the man can maintain his balance while applying internal forces (muscles) and responding to outside forces (wind, slopes,booze) - walking!

- Ability to immediately recalibrate based on new weights and contraints on limbs and body to maintain balance.
- Intention - move body and objects in the environment - throwing, pushing - while mainting balance.
